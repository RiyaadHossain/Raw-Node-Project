1 You will have to create a server using core node_modules where there will be a root route (‘/’). ✅

2 When a user hits the root route(‘/) with GET request you will have to send an HTML file containing ‘‘Welcome to Full Stack Development “. ✅

3 You will have to create a file in the root folder of your project called first.txt containing some text.
For example: “ I am a pull stack developer !!! 🤣 ” ✅

4 There will be four more routes to handle requests. When a user hits the routes you will have to do the following:

   4.1 '/read' - to read the first.txt file from the file system using the core fs module. 🙌
   
   4.2 '/write' - You have to read the text of the first.txt file and write it to the second.txt file. 
   
   4.3 '/append' - You have to append the text “ No! It will be full not pull ! 😑 ” in the first.txt file.
   
   4.4 '/delete' - You have to delete the second.txt file.
